ABOUT
Backup multiple locations to either a local secondary disk or a remote server using rsync (+ logging and configurability)
The use case is a computer with two or more physical disks and a remote server rsync; the aim is to have maximum fault tollerance: 
if the primary disk fails, the second disk should be uptodate, if the computer get lost or destroyed the remote server should hold the most important data. 
this script uses rsync and wraps some logic, logging and convenience around it.

DEPENDENCIES
it is a PHP script (>= 5.2) (maybe apt-get install php5-cli)
made for common linux distros (assumes some binaries in PATH)
	rsync (the real work)
	whoami (check for root privileges)
	find (find old logfiles)
	rm (delete old logfiles)
	nice (run process with low priority)
	ionice (as above)
	mount (optional: mount the backup drive as readonly if not needed)
currently it has some ugly dependencies (that are too specific to my system)
	notify-send  (notify with nice popups - used in ubuntu. apt-get install libnotify-bin)
	tune2fs (get mount counter - mount enforces periodic fsck after n mounts of a partition)
	e2fsck (is specific to ext partitions, if you use something else: fix it, make a pull request :)

GETTING STARTED
copy config.json-dist to config.json. adjust it to your system (the log folder needs to exist). be carefull, you might overwrite data.
add a cron job calling rsync-php hourly (or less frequent). the remote rsync uses passwordless ssh, that needs to be configured manually.
